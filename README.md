i am a gnostic athiest. this means i believe no god exists, and i know no god exists. this is the result of me being a very firm naturalist. naturalism, in philosophy, is the belief that only natural laws and forces operate in the universe. **i will respect those who are religious,** but if you try to force me to believe in something i don't believe exists, then i will just block you.

**do not interact**

 i block freely. if i don't like you, or i feel as though we won't get along then i will block you. it's as simple as that.

please see "my opinions" to find out if we will get along.

 **before you interact**

 i am mentally ill and neurodivergent. i struggle to feel sorry for others, and i am extremely blunt. i may have disorganized speech patterns, and i do need a lot of time to myself. i will purposefully ignore people if i don't want to talk.

 please do not use tone indicators on me. if you're a friend, i don't care. if you're a stranger, please don't. this also applies to they/them pronouns, except i don't want anyone using they on me.

<summary>my opinions</summary>
<br>
i shouldn't have to hide my opinions on controversial subjects in this game. here they are.


1. **any form of queer discourse;** homophobes and transphobes will see us the same way. i don't care if someone identifies as a lesboy as long as they aren't hurting me.
2. **proshipping**; i firmly believe the proship community is a community that facilitates grooming-like behaviors, and is dangerous to be in. i personally am anti-harassment, but not in the proship way. i believe that nobody should be harassed or threatened for something as simple as a headcanon. i believe in the power of blocking and scrolling.
3. **endogenic systems**; staunchly anti-endo. nobody can change my opinions
4. **touch trigger / touch discomfort**; i see it as a mockery of my triggers related to touch. i don't support it at all. it's also not possible.
5. **systems in general on this game**; i feel like some of them are heavily misinformed about the symptoms of did. if i have to see one more person call **DISSOCIATIVE** identity disorder a personality disorder or anything similar, i'm going to scream.
6. **delusional attachments**; [this explains all my viewpoints](https://gdoc.pub/doc/e/2PACX-1vTRiUQuLNmr-Zg2RD8nOuDHocT8HPQPzNB79Hf1pNdYFXbAkRGt4kpSt3oZBxih_ubVy5pqaZJ9FqyX#:~:text=It%20is%20rarely%20a%20constant,be%20able%20to%20recognize%20it)
