I've taken it upon myself to actually educate people on DID because it's obvious people don't know what it is or just blindly believe information on Carrds.

<summary>What is DID?</summary>
  
> DID is a complex dissociative disorder that is characterized by the presence of two or more distinct identity states. It develops as the result of trauma occurring during a person's childhood **specifically** before the ages of 5-10. The role the trauma has in the development of DID is that it stunts the development of a central integrated consciousness. This, alongside disorganized attachment from caregivers and their denial of the traumas happening to the child causes the child to develop DID as a coping mechanism for their current situation.

<summary>DID vs OSDD-1</summary>
  
> OSDD-1, or other specified dissociative disorder subtype 1, is a dissociative disorder that develops like DID but is missing one of the main diagnostic features of DID. For example, someone with OSDD-1 may have parts or alters that are less distinct from each other or may lack significant amnesia for a full DID diagnosis. This, however, does not mean they don't experience amnesia. Someone with OSDD-1 could experience emotional amnesia, but not blackout amnesia.

> When looking at OSDD-1 and DID, one of the crucial parts to look at is the types of structural dissociation associated with each disorder.

> Unlike other disorders that fall under secondary structural dissociation, OSDD-1 has more developed emotional parts (EPs). The EPs in OSDD-1 aren't as developed as those in DID, though. Another difference is that OSDD-1 lacks one of the diagnostic criteria for a DID diagnosis.

<summary>DID myths</summary>
  
| Myth  | Truth |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Alters / a system can form without trauma  | Alters, and by extension systems, don't form for no reason. This is because your identity doesn't not integrate for no reason.  |
| DID is very rare  | According to the DSM-5 and DSM-5-TR, DID is found in 1.5% of the global population. This means that it is found in 122,130,000 people. If you do the math, you will find that it actually not that rare, but it is hard to diagnose as DID is a covert disorder.  |
| Fictives/Introjects are rare  | This is false because a lot of people, including those without DID, introject people and even characters. Have you ever been with friends and have started adopting their characteristics? Or, have you ever liked a character a lot that you started to adopt how they speak and act? That is a form of [introjection](https://dictionary.apa.org/introjection). In many cases, [people with DID have had alters that mimicked the characteristics of their abusers](https://medcraveonline.com/JPCPY/introjection-and-dissociative-identity-disorder-a-case-report.html). It's not farfetched for pw/DID to introject characters as well. It's important to note that not everyone who experiences introjection has DID. It's a regular human experience, but it also occurs in DID.   |
| If you think you have DID, then you have it!  | Saying this does more harm than good. If you suspect you have DID, it's important to do your research and if it's accessible go to a medical professional. Just because you're questioning if you have DID doesn't automatically mean you have it. A lot of disorders overlap with DID, and it's easy to confuse symptoms of another disorder as DID symptoms.  |
| Everyone online who says they have DID is faking!  | This is extremely false. Sure, there are some people who are faking DID online, but this doesn't mean that everyone is faking. If you have suspicions that someone is faking, it's better to keep it to yourself than speak out about it. You are not their psychiatrist nor are you qualified to comment on someone's life.    |
| Everyone who has DID must be miserable!  | This is a very harmful generalization. Sure, some people with DID may have a poor quality of life, but not everyone with DID lives a miserable life. There are plenty of people with DID who live great lives and are very happy.    |
| Only adults can have DID  | DID is a disorder that forms in your childhood. Saying only adults can have it is laughably wrong. Many people become aware they have DID in their adulthood, yes, but this doesn't mean people who aren't adults don't have DID. A lot of teenagers do get diagnosed with DID.    |
| DID is only about fictives/factives/introjects  | This is laughably false. DID is a dissociative disorder, not a "fictional characters that live in my head" disorder. While introjects can occur in DID and OSDD-1, that's not the only aspect of the disorder and this misinformation is what causes people to not believe it exists nor believe people when they say they have it. Also, not everyone with DID has introjects. Sure, it is a common occurance, but not everyone with the disorder has them.  |
| DID isn't real  | If it wasn't real, why would there be a whole section on it in the DSM-5 and ICD-11? Some psychiatrists still deny its existence, yes, but this doesn't automatically make it fake.  |
| If you have DID, you can't know about your alters.  | While it is possible for someone to live their entire life not knowing that they have alters, this is false. To recover, it's required for you to become aware of your parts so that you can work through your trauma.  |
| Switches in DID are overt / Easily noticable  | DID is a covert disorder meaning that switches will not be obvious. While it is possible for someone to have overt switches, it's not too common.    |
